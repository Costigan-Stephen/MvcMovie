            and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
            Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>
            Like most website operators, LDS Videos collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers
            typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. LDS Videos's purpose
            in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how LDS Video's visitors use its website. From time to time, LDS Videos may
            release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>
        <p>
            LDS Videos also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
            users leaving comments on http://www.Ldsvideos.com blog posts. LDS Videos only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
            absolute security.
        </p>

            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad
            server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
            This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
            Policy covers the use of cookies by LDS Videos and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
        </p>
        <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>
            LDS Videos discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors

            Desk's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
            outside of your home country; by using LDS Videos's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. LDS Videos will not rent or sell
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
